### Introduction

**ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions greatly simplify the job of the developer by providing the 
illusion that each transaction has exclusive access to the data. In a microservice architecture, transactions that are within a
single service can still use ACID transactions. The challenge, however, lies in implementing transactions for operations that 
update data owned by multiple services as each microservice holds its own database.

Transactionality in microservice systems can be realized by applying some well-known design patterns like **SAGA**.
SAGA, a message-driven sequence of local transactions, to maintain data consistency across microservices. One challenge with sagas is that they are ACD (Atomicity, Consistency,Durability). They lack the isolation feature of traditional ACID transactions. Another
challenge is rolling back changes when an error occurs. 

A great feature of traditional ACID transactions is that the business logic can easily
roll back a transaction if it detects the violation of a business rule. It executes a ROLL-
BACK statement, and the database undoes all the changes made so far. Unfortunately,
sagas canâ€™t be automatically rolled back, because each step commits its changes to the
local database.

SAGA pattern can be implemented in two different ways.
1. Choreography SAGA
2. Orchestration SAGA
